Complier - GCC (Linux)
While compiling the cc-extractor code, the following warnings were encountered -

1) Warning Message : "warning: ignoring return value of ‘write’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]" 

The function "write(arguments)" is called many times in different 'C' files. This function has an integer type return value. In all of the cases where the complier throws a warning, this return value has been ignored. The function was just called as if it were having a void type return value.  

It is always safe to take the written value from the function and check if anything has gone wrong during the function execution. This would remove the warning.



2) Warning Message : "warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]"

sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), (char *) encoder->encoded_crlf);

In general, sprintf also takes an additional argument - The format of the buffer, whether it is a string or an integer and so on. But here no format has been mentioned. This is as good as writing "printf(str)" where str is a character string. Instead it should have been printf("%s",str).
We need not mention the format type if we wish to print a string literal such as printf("Hello World"). But here we do nat have a string literal.
So sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), "%s", (char *) encoder->encoded_crlf); would remove the warning.


3) Warning Message : "implicit declaration of function ‘temporarily_close_output’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]"

This particularly means that a function has been called for which the compiler has not yet seen a declaration/protype. This might have happened due to the missing of declaration function in a header file. 

It could be easily fixed by including such function declarations in any header file which is used by that file.
(For example in lib_ccx/ccx_encoders_common.h)
Also it has to be seen that there are no multiple declarations (By using #ifdef).


4) Warning Message : "warning: format ‘%llx’ expects argument of type ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 6 has type ‘uint64_t’ [-Wformat=]"

This is a general warning which gives incorrect format for printing. uint65_t is a non-standard format type in C. While, sprintf requires an argument saying which type of format (format specifier) is required, here %llx has been used where in the argument is actually of type uint64_t. 

One thing which could have been done was to use "%" format specifier. This did not throw any warning.
Another thing which could have done is to typecaste uint64_t to unsigned long long hex before printing. This also would prevent the warning from coming up. (But in the output "lu" would be added as a suffix to the result).
